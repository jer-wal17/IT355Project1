Basketball, a basketball
Yeah, well, your mother is a basketball
I went there, your mother is a basketball
A basketball, she's a basketball
Stop
Everybody take 5
Good show, guys, but I don't feel a vibe
Let it all out, don't hold back; incriminate
Here on this court, you gotta push it to the limit, mate
Reach deep inside, throw the shots, come alive
I'll be here tweeting the whole thing live
So guys, be loquacious
Show off your gall!
What did you say his mother was again?
A basketball
